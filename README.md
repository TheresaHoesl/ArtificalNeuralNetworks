Projects of the course "Artifical Neural Networks and Deep Learning". It covered generalisation, computational nature of supervised as well as unsupervised learning in different network types and deep learning algorithms. More over, 
>Lab1a and b covers Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), the implementation: of a single perceptron from scratch, backprop from scratch and different networks using TensorFlow and Sklearn for a time-series prediction.
>Lab2 covers RBF networks and Competitive Learning (CL), SOMs for ordering animal species, clustering of votes in the swedish parliament, solving the travelling salesman problem.
